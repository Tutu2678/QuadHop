QuadHop is a web-based platform designed to provide an on-demand vanpool service, offering a convenient transportation solution for users. The prototype for QuadHop is available on GitHub and showcases key functionalities through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Users can request a ride by entering pick-up and drop-off locations along with a desired pick-up time. For students, the platform supports the upload of academic timetables for a seamless integration with their transportation needs through a monthly subscription service. Additional sections, such as "About Us" and "FAQ," provide essential information about the service to build trust and transparency.

The GitHub repository includes a responsive design powered by industry-standard technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a modern UI experience. Mapbox integration dynamically displays available vanpool locations, allowing users to interact with a visual map of the service area. The repository also follows best practices to ensure compatibility across various devices and browsers.

Future development plans, outlined in the GitHub project roadmap, include enhancements to the ride request system, integration with additional services, and improvements to user experience based on analytics and feedback.

With a commitment to quality, scalability, and sustainability, QuadHop's prototype showcases the potential for revolutionizing modern commuting. Access the GitHub repository to explore the code and contribute to future developments.
